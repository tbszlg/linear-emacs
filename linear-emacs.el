;;; Commentary:

;; linear-emacs.el provides an interface to Linear.app issue tracking from Emacs.
;; It allows you to view, create, and update issues without leaving your editor.

;;; Code:

;;
;; This file is organized into the following sections:
;;
;; - Dependencies and requirements
;; - Customization and variables
;; - Core API functions (async-first)
;; - Team management functions
;; - Issue management functions
;; - Issue state management functions
;; - Org-mode integration functions
;; - Mapping functions (between Linear and org-mode)
;; - User-facing commands
;; - Org-mode sync hooks
;; - Backward compatibility functions
