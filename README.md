### Using Doom Emacs

In your `packages.el`:
```elisp
(package! linear-emacs
  :recipe (:host github :repo "anegg0/linear-emacs" :files ("*.el")))
```

In your `config.el`:
```elisp
(use-package! linear-emacs
  :commands (linear-emacs-list-issues
             linear-emacs-new-issue
             linear-emacs-enable-org-sync)
  :config
  ;; Load API key from environment or auth-source
  (linear-emacs-load-api-key-from-env)
  
  ;; Optional: Set default team
  ;; (setq linear-emacs-default-team-id "your-team-id")
  
  ;; Optional: Customize org file location
  ;; (setq linear-emacs-org-file-path (expand-file-name "gtd/linear.org" org-directory))
  
  ;; Optional: Customize state mapping (see Status Mapping section below)
  ;; (setq linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping
  ;;       '(("Todo" . "TODO")
  ;;         ("In Progress" . "DOING")
  ;;         ("Done" . "DONE")))
  )

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

There are several ways to set your Linear API key:

#### Direct Setting (Not Recommended)

```elisp
(setq linear-emacs-api-key "your-api-key-here")
```

#### Environment Variable (Better)

Set the `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable and load it with:

```elisp
(linear-emacs-load-api-key-from-env)
```

#### Using auth-source (Recommended)

For secure credential storage, use Emacs' built-in auth-source package:

```elisp
(defun my/linear-load-api-key-from-auth-source ()
  "Load Linear API key from auth-source."
  (interactive)
  (require 'auth-source)
  (let* ((auth-info (auth-source-search :host "api.linear.app" :user "apikey" :max 1))
         (secret (when auth-info
                   (funcall (plist-get (car auth-info) :secret)))))
    (if secret
        (progn
          (setq linear-emacs-api-key secret)
          (message "Successfully loaded Linear API key from auth-source"))
      (message "Failed to retrieve Linear API key from auth-source"))))

;; Call this function when linear loads
(after! linear-emacs
  (my/linear-load-api-key-from-auth-source))
```

To set up your auth-source entry:

1. For macOS Keychain users, run:
   ```
   security add-generic-password -a apikey -s api.linear.app -w YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

2. For `~/.authinfo.gpg` users, add this line to your file:
   ```
   machine api.linear.app login apikey password YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

Note: The hostname (`api.linear.app`) and username (`apikey`) in your auth-source entry must match exactly what you're using in the `auth-source-search` function.

You can get your API key from Linear.app under Settings > Account > API > Personal API Keys.

Optionally, set a default team ID to streamline issue creation:

```elisp
(setq linear-emacs-default-team-id "your-team-id")
```

### Async Configuration

The package uses async-first architecture by default for better performance and responsiveness. You can customize this behavior:

```elisp
;; Enable/disable async API calls (default: t)
(setq linear-emacs-async-default t)

;; Enable/disable progress messages during operations (default: t)
(setq linear-emacs-progress-messages t)
```

When `linear-emacs-progress-messages` is enabled, you'll see helpful progress indicators:
- `[Linear] Fetching issues... (page 1)`
- `[Linear] Retrieved 50 issues (fetching page 2)...`
- `[Linear] Retrieved 150 issues (complete)`

This keeps you informed during long-running operations without blocking your workflow.

### Customizing the Output Path

By default, Linear issues are saved to `gtd/linear.org` in your `org-directory`. You can customize this location:

```elisp
;; Change the output file location
(setq linear-emacs-org-file-path "/path/to/your/linear-issues.org")

;; Or use a different subdirectory in your org-directory
(setq linear-emacs-org-file-path (expand-file-name "projects/linear.org" org-directory))
```

### Org-Mode Integration

#### Complete Doom Emacs Configuration

Here's a comprehensive Doom Emacs configuration that includes API key management, state mapping, and auto-sync:

```elisp
;; In your config.el
(use-package! linear-emacs
  :after org
  :commands (linear-emacs-list-issues
             linear-emacs-new-issue
             linear-emacs-enable-org-sync
             linear-emacs-sync-org-to-linear)
  :init
  ;; Set file path before package loads
  (setq linear-emacs-org-file-path (expand-file-name "gtd/linear.org" org-directory))
  
  :config
  ;; Load API key from environment
  (linear-emacs-load-api-key-from-env)
  
  ;; Or use auth-source for secure storage
  ;; (my/linear-load-api-key-from-auth-source)
  
  ;; Customize state mapping to match your workflow
  (setq linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping
        '(("Todo" . "TODO")
          ("In Progress" . "DOING")
          ("In Review" . "REVIEW")
          ("Blocked" . "HOLD")
          ("Done" . "DONE")))
  
  ;; Optional: Set default team to skip selection prompt
  ;; (setq linear-emacs-default-team-id "your-team-id")
  
  ;; Auto-enable sync when linear.org is opened
  (defun my/enable-linear-org-sync ()
    "Enable Linear-org synchronization when linear.org is opened."
    (when (and buffer-file-name
               (string-match-p "linear\\.org$" buffer-file-name))
      (linear-emacs-enable-org-sync)
      (message "Linear-org synchronization enabled for this buffer")))
  
  (add-hook 'find-file-hook #'my/enable-linear-org-sync)
  
  ;; Keybindings
  (map! :leader
        (:prefix ("l" . "linear")
         :desc "List Linear issues" "l" #'linear-emacs-list-issues
         :desc "Create new issue" "n" #'linear-emacs-new-issue
         :desc "Sync current issue" "s" #'linear-emacs-sync-org-to-linear
         :desc "Enable org sync" "e" #'linear-emacs-enable-org-sync
         :desc "Disable org sync" "d" #'linear-emacs-disable-org-sync
         :desc "Test connection" "t" #'linear-emacs-test-connection
         :desc "Toggle debug mode" "D" #'linear-emacs-toggle-debug)))

;; Ensure org-todo-keywords match your Linear mapping
(after! org
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence "TODO(t)" "DOING(d)" "REVIEW(r)" "HOLD(h)" "|" "DONE(D)"))))
```

#### Basic Setup

For a simpler setup with automatic synchronization:

```elisp
;; In your config.el
(after! linear-emacs
  (linear-emacs-load-api-key-from-env)
  
  ;; Automatically enable two-way sync when linear.org is opened
  (defun my/enable-linear-org-sync ()
    "Enable Linear-org synchronization when linear.org is opened."
    (when (and buffer-file-name
               (string-match-p "linear\\.org$" buffer-file-name))
      (when (fboundp 'linear-emacs-enable-org-sync)
        (linear-emacs-enable-org-sync)
        (message "Linear-org synchronization enabled for this buffer"))))
  
  ;; Add hook to auto-enable sync when linear.org is opened
  (add-hook 'find-file-hook #'my/enable-linear-org-sync)
  
  ;; Enable sync for org-after-todo-state-change-hook
  (add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook
            (lambda ()
              (when (and buffer-file-name
                         (string-match-p "linear\\.org$" buffer-file-name)
                         (fboundp 'linear-emacs-sync-org-to-linear))
                (linear-emacs-sync-org-to-linear)))))
```

When you run `M-x linear-emacs-list-issues`, the package will create a file with all your assigned issues at the location specified by `linear-org-file-path` (see "Customizing the Output Path" above).

The org file will have the following structure:

```org
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a12acb12-8a69-4d15-a846-21e20ed2f3ae
#+title: Linear issues assigned to me
#+TAGS: :
#+filetags: :twai:b:
#+STARTUP: overview
#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS IN-REVIEW BACKLOG BLOCKED | DONE
:END:

*** TODO [#B] Issue Title
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       issue-unique-id
:ID-LINEAR: TEAM-123
:TEAM: Team Name
:PROJECT: Mobile App Redesign
:PROJECT-ID: proj-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
:DESCRIPTION: |
  Issue description goes here
:PRIORITY: High
:LABELS: [mobile, ui, redesign]
:LINK: https://linear.app/issue/TEAM-123
:END:
```

When you change the TODO state of an issue in the org file, it will automatically synchronize with Linear.

### Status Mapping

The `linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping` variable provides a unified configuration for mapping between Linear issue states and Org-mode TODO states. This single configuration controls:

- Which Linear issues are synced to your Org file (only issues with mapped states are included)
- How Linear states are converted to Org TODO keywords
- How Org TODO keywords are converted back to Linear states
- Dynamic generation of regex patterns for matching Org headings

#### Default Mapping

```elisp
'(("Todo" . "TODO")
  ("In Progress" . "IN-PROGRESS")
  ("In Review" . "IN-REVIEW")
  ("Backlog" . "BACKLOG")
  ("Blocked" . "BLOCKED")
  ("Done" . "DONE"))
```

#### Customization

You can customize the state mapping to match your workflow:

```elisp
;; Simple workflow
(setq linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping
      '(("Todo" . "TODO")
        ("In Progress" . "DOING")
        ("Done" . "DONE")))

;; Extended workflow with custom states
(setq linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping
      '(("Todo" . "TODO")
        ("In Progress" . "WORKING")
        ("In Review" . "REVIEW")
        ("Testing" . "TEST")
        ("Blocked" . "HOLD")
        ("Done" . "DONE")
        ("Cancelled" . "CANCELLED")))
```

Add a single state to the existing mapping:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping '("On Hold" . "HOLD"))
```

#### Doom Emacs Configuration

For Doom Emacs users, configure the state mapping in your `config.el`:

```elisp
(after! linear-emacs
  ;; Custom state mapping for your workflow
  (setq linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping
        '(("Todo" . "TODO")
          ("In Progress" . "WIP")
          ("In Review" . "REVIEW")
          ("Done" . "DONE")))
  
  ;; Ensure your org-todo-keywords match
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WIP(w)" "REVIEW(r)" "|" "DONE(d)"))))
```

**Important**: Make sure your `org-todo-keywords` configuration includes all the Org states you use in your mapping. The package dynamically generates regex patterns based on your mapping to match Org headings.

#### How Dynamic Pattern Generation Works

The package automatically generates regex patterns from your state mapping configuration. This means:

1. **No hardcoded patterns**: The regex patterns used to match Org headings are built dynamically from your `linear-emacs-issues-state-mapping`

2. **Automatic updates**: When you change your state mapping, the patterns are automatically regenerated

3. **Performance optimized**: Patterns are cached for efficiency and only regenerated when needed

For example, with this mapping:
```elisp
'(("Todo" . "TODO")
  ("In Progress" . "WORKING")
  ("Done" . "DONE"))
```

The package generates the pattern: `"TODO\\|WORKING\\|DONE"`

This pattern is then used to match Org headings like:
- `*** TODO Fix the bug`
- `*** WORKING Implement feature`
- `*** DONE Complete documentation`

### Priority Mapping

Map Linear priorities to org priorities:

```elisp
(setq linear-emacs-org-priority-mapping
      '((0 . nil)   ; No priority
        (1 . "A")   ; Urgent
        (2 . "B")   ; High
        (3 . "C")   ; Medium
        (4 . "D"))) ; Low
```

## Usage

### Commands

- `M-x linear-emacs-list-issues` - Display your assigned issues
- `M-x linear-emacs-list-issues-by-project` - Display issues filtered by a selected project
- `M-x linear-emacs-new-issue` - Create a new issue (with project selection)
- `M-x linear-emacs-test-connection` - Test your Linear API connection
- `M-x linear-emacs-toggle-debug` - Toggle debug mode for troubleshooting
- `M-x linear-emacs-check-setup` - Verify your API key is loaded correctly

### Org-Mode Integration Commands

- `M-x linear-emacs-list-issues` - Pull issues from Linear into org-mode
- `M-x linear-emacs-sync-org-to-linear` - Sync the current org entry to Linear
- `M-x linear-emacs-enable-org-sync` - Enable automatic synchronization
- `M-x linear-emacs-disable-org-sync` - Disable automatic synchronization

#### Improved Synchronization Commands

The following commands are available in the optimized configuration:

- `M-x my/linear-sync-single-issue-at-point` - Sync only the current issue at point
- `M-x my/toggle-linear-auto-sync` - Toggle automatic syncing before showing todo list

### Recommended Keybindings

For Doom Emacs, you can set up convenient keybindings:

```elisp
(map! :leader
      (:prefix ("l" . "Linear")
       :desc "Sync all Linear issues" "s" #'linear-emacs-list-issues
       :desc "List issues by project" "p" #'linear-emacs-list-issues-by-project
       :desc "New issue" "n" #'linear-emacs-new-issue
       :desc "Toggle Linear auto-sync" "t" #'my/toggle-linear-auto-sync
       :desc "Test connection" "c" #'linear-emacs-test-connection
       :desc "Toggle debug" "d" #'linear-emacs-toggle-debug))
```

In the optimized configuration, these keybindings are already set up for you:

```elisp
(map! :leader
      :prefix "l"
      :desc "Sync all Linear issues" "s" #'linear-emacs-list-issues
      :desc "Toggle Linear auto-sync" "t" #'my/toggle-linear-auto-sync)
```

## Performance & Architecture

### Async-First Design

The package has been refactored with an async-first architecture that provides significant performance improvements:

**Benefits:**
- **Non-blocking operations**: Emacs remains fully responsive during API calls
- **Progressive pagination**: Issues are fetched in batches with real-time progress updates
- **Request tracking**: Active request counter prevents overwhelming the API
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing synchronous functions still work via wrapper functions

**How it works:**
- All API calls use callbacks instead of blocking
- Large issue lists are fetched progressively (100 issues per page)
- Progress messages keep you informed: `[Linear] Retrieved 50 issues (fetching page 2)...`
- Background synchronization doesn't interrupt your editing workflow

**Example:**
```elisp
;; Async version (default)
(linear-emacs-list-issues)  ; Returns immediately, updates when ready

;; Progress messages appear:
;; [Linear] Fetching issues...
;; [Linear] Retrieved 50 issues (fetching page 2)...
;; [Linear] Retrieved 150 issues (complete)
;; Updated Linear issues in ~/org/gtd/linear.org with 150 active issues
```

### Synchronization Optimization

To avoid synchronization performance issues, the optimized configuration:

1. Only synchronizes the current issue at point instead of all issues
2. Makes automatic synchronization optional with a toggle
3. Adds convenient keybindings for managing synchronization

```elisp
;; In your config.el
(after! linear-emacs
  ;; Improved synchronization function that only updates the changed issue
  (defun my/linear-sync-single-issue-at-point ()
    "Sync only the current issue at point to Linear API."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      ;; Move to the beginning of the current heading
      (org-back-to-heading t)
      ;; Check if this is a Linear issue heading
      (when (looking-at "^\\*\\*\\* \\(TODO\\|IN-PROGRESS\\|IN-REVIEW\\|BACKLOG\\|BLOCKED\\|DONE\\)")
        ;; [Implementation details omitted for brevity]
        )))

  ;; Override linear-emacs-sync-org-to-linear to only sync the current issue
  (defun linear-emacs-sync-org-to-linear ()
    "Sync only the current issue to Linear API."
    (interactive)
    (my/linear-sync-single-issue-at-point))

  ;; Add convenient keybinding for manually syncing all issues
  (map! :leader
        :prefix "l"
        :desc "Sync all Linear issues" "s" #'linear-emacs-list-issues
        :desc "Toggle Linear auto-sync" "t" #'my/toggle-linear-auto-sync))
```

## Customization

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```elisp
(setq linear-emacs-debug t)
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Check your connection:
   ```
   M-x linear-emacs-test-connection
   ```

2. Enable debug mode:
   ```
   M-x linear-emacs-toggle-debug
   ```

3. Verify your API key is loaded correctly:
   ```
   M-x linear-emacs-check-setup
   ```

4. Check the `*Messages*` buffer for detailed error information when debug mode is enabled
